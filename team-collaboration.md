## Sprint Planning Process

### 2-Week Sprint Cycle
- **Sprint Planning**: Mondays - Select tasks, estimate effort, assign ownership
- **Daily Standup**: Brief async updates on progress and blockers
- **Mid-Sprint Review**: Wednesday check-in on progress
- **Sprint Review**: Friday - Demo completed work, retrospective
- **Sprint Planning**: Following Monday - Plan next sprint

### Task Estimation Scale
- **XS (1-2 hours)**: Simple fixes, minor updates
- **S (Half day)**: Small features, straightforward implementation
- **M (1-2 days)**: Medium complexity features
- **L (3-5 days)**: Complex features, multiple components
- **XL (1+ weeks)**: Major initiatives, break down into smaller tasks

## Communication Protocols

### Update Frequency
- **Daily**: Progress updates in shared channel
- **Weekly**: Formal sprint review and planning
- **Monthly**: Strategic review and priority adjustment
- **Quarterly**: Team retrospective and goal setting

### Escalation Paths
1. **Technical Blockers**: Evan → Bernie (same day)
2. **Client Issues**: Anyone → Bernie (immediate)
3. **Resource Constraints**: Anyone → Team Discussion (weekly)
4. **Strategic Changes**: Bernie → Team Notification (immediate)

## Progress Tracking

### Individual Task Tracking
- **Status**: Not Started, In Progress, Review, Complete
- **Owner**: Primary responsible person
- **Estimate**: Time investment estimate
- **Actual**: Time actually spent
- **Blockers**: Dependencies or issues preventing completion

### Team Velocity Tracking
- **Story Points Completed**: Per sprint
- **Cycle Time**: Average time from start to completion
- **Quality Metrics**: Bugs per feature, rework percentage
- **Client Satisfaction**: Feedback scores and testimonials

## Decision Integration

### Decision Log Process
- **Individual Decisions**: Record in personal notes
- **Team Decisions**: Add to cdc-decisions repository
- **Architecture Decisions**: Formal ADR process
- **Business Decisions**: Strategy document updates

### Avoiding Decision Conflicts
- **Decision Numbering**: Sequential, managed in cdc-decisions repo
- **Review Process**: Pull request for all decision additions
- **Approval Authority**: Bernie for strategic, Evan for technical implementation
- **Communication**: All decisions communicated in team channel
